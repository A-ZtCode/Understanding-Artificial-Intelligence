# Understanding Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
Understanding Artificial Intelligence" delves into the practical applications and ethical considerations of AI. It's an exploration into how AI can be used for real-world problem solving, with a focus on water quality analysis, object recognition, and the ethical dimensions of AI technology.

 
## Table of Contents
### 1. Water Quality Analysis
   - Using data from CEFAS 2021, this project applies a multi-layer feed-forward neural network to identify patterns in biotoxins and phytoplankton concentrations. Key topics include data handling, neural network training, and performance evaluation.
### 2. Multi-object Recogniser
   - This part utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a dataset on vehicle recognition. It explores training accuracy, network depth, pooling mechanisms, and model explainability.
### 3. Discussion of Ethics in AI
   - A comprehensive discussion based on selected research papers, focusing on the ethical considerations and real-world implications of AI.
