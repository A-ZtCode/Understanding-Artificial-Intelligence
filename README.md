### Water Quality Analysis
Using CEFAS's 2021 data on biotoxins and phytoplankton, this project aims to identify patterns of concentrations based on certain features. A multi-layer feed-forward neural network assists in this objective.

#### Key Topics:
- Reading and cleaning data.
- Training a neural network based on input features.
- Evaluating network performance and accuracy.

#### Data Source:
CEFAS 2021 Data on Biotoxins and Phytoplankton


### Multi-object Recogniser
For this segment, we leverage the "vehicles" dataset and adapt a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize four distinct object types. Additionally, a curated dataset showcases images of these objects in diverse scenarios.

#### Key Topics:
- Training and validation accuracy.
- The relationship between network depth and performance.
- Pooling mechanisms: average vs. max.
- Fine-tuning and model explainability.

### Discussion of Ethics in AI
The realm of artificial intelligence is vast and continually evolving, with ethical considerations at its core. This section offers an in-depth discussion based on selected research papers, emphasizing the ethical facets of AI.

#### Key Topics:
- Ethical considerations in AI research.
- Implications of AI in various real-world contexts.
